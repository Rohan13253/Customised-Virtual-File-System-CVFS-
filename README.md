# 🚀 **Customised Virtual File System (CVFS)**

A custom implementation of a Virtual File System built in **C/C++**.

This project simulates the core functionality of the Linux File System by implementing the kernel-level data structures required for file management. Instead of interacting with the actual hard disk, it maintains a **Virtual Disk in RAM**, providing a **custom shell** to interact with the system.

---

## 🏗️ **Technical Architecture**

The file system is **monolithic** and runs entirely in **user space**. It relies on internally defined data structures to manage metadata and data allocation, mimicking the Unix File Subsystem.

---

## 🔑 **Key Data Structures Implemented**

### 📌 **`struct Inode` (Linked List)**

* Holds file metadata: File Size, Type (Regular/Special), Permissions
* Implemented as a **Linked List** to support dynamic file creation

### 📌 **`struct FileTable`**

* Maintains:

  * ReadOffset
  * WriteOffset
* Stores runtime context for every open file

### 📌 **`struct SuperBlock`**

* Manages global file system state:

  * Total inode count
  * Free inode count
  * File system limits

### 📌 **`struct UAREA` (User Area)**

* Contains the **UFDT** (User File Descriptor Table)
* Maps **File Descriptors (FD)** → internal FileTable pointers

## ⚙️ **Configuration Macros**

| Macro                      | Value      | Description                |
| -------------------------- | ---------- | -------------------------- |
| **MAXINODE**               | 50         | Maximum number of files    |
| **MAXFILESIZE**            | 1024 bytes | Fixed block size per file  |
| **READ / WRITE / EXECUTE** | 1 / 2 / 4  | Standard permission macros |

---

## 🛠️ **Project Features**

### ✔️ Custom Shell

A built-in command-line interface to interpret user inputs and execute system calls.

### ✔️ System Call Simulation

Implements custom logic for:
`open`, `close`, `read`, `write`, `lseek`

### ✔️ Dynamic Memory Management

Uses `malloc` and `free` to allocate inodes and reclaim memory on file deletion.

### ✔️ Error Handling

Custom error codes `(-1 to -7)` for:

* Insufficient Space
* File Not Found
* Permission Denied
* Invalid Operation

## 📚 **Command Support**

| Command    | Description           | Usage                       |
| ---------- | --------------------- | --------------------------- |
| **creat**  | Create a new file     | `creat [name] [permission]` |
| **write**  | Write data to a file  | `write [fd]`                |
| **read**   | Read data from a file | `read [fd] [size]`          |
| **ls**     | List all files        | `ls`                        |
| **stat**   | Show file metadata    | `stat [name]`               |
| **unlink** | Delete a file         | `unlink [name]`             |
| **clear**  | Clear console         | `clear`                     |
| **exit**   | Exit the system       | `exit`                      |

---

## 💻 **Usage**

### 🧪 **Compilation**

```bash
g++ CVFS.cpp -o Myexe
```

### ▶️ **Running the Shell**

```bash
./Myexe
```

---

## 📝 **Example Session**

```
CVFS > help
... displays command list ...

CVFS > creat Notes.txt 3
File created successfully with FD: 0

CVFS > write 0
Enter Data: Hello World
11 bytes written successfully.

CVFS > stat Notes.txt
File Name: Notes.txt
File Size: 1024
Link Count: 1
```

---

## 🔮 **Future Enhancements**

* [ ] **Persistence:** Save inodes and data blocks to physical disk
* [ ] **Multi-user support:** Enhance UAREA for multiple user environments
* [ ] **Directory Support:** Add hierarchical directory structure
